# in approximate order of difficulty
Descriptive
Exploratory
Inferential
Predictive
Causal
Mechanistic


#*****
Descriptive:
#*****
Goal: describe a set of data

the first kind of data analysis performed
commonly applied to census data
the description and interpretation are different steps
descriptions can usally not be generalized without additional statistical modeling

#*****
Exploratory
#*****
Goal: Find relationships you didn't know about

Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections
they are also useful for defining future studies
exploratory analyses are usually not the final say
exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting
correlation DOES NOT imply causation


#*****
Inferential analysis
#*****
Goal: Use a relatively small sample of data to say sth about a bigger population 
Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models
Interence involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainy about your estimate
Inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme


#*****
Predictive analysis
#*****
Goal: To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object
 to use the data on some objects you collect the data on, to predict the values for another object for the next observation that comes to the door. 

if X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y
Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables
Although where are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model works really well
Prediction is very hard, especially about the future references


#*****
Mechanistic analysis
#*****
rarely in rarely covered in data science.
Goal: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in ohter variables for individual objects

Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations(physicalengineering science)
Generally the random component of the data is measurement error
If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis



#*****
Causal analysis
#*****
Goal: to find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change

usually randomized studies are required to identify causation
There are approaches to inferring causation in anon-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumption
Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may no apply to every individual
Causal models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis
