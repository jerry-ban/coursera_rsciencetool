Principles of Analytic Graphics
principle-1: Show comparisons
p-2: Show causality, mechanize, explanation
p-3: show multivariate data
p-4: integrate multiple modes of evidence
p-5: describe and document the evidence
p-6: content is king

Steps in data analysis:
define the question
defne the ideal data set
determine what data you can access
obtain the data
clean the data
exploratory data analysis
statistical predicton/modeling
interpret results
challenge results
synthesize/write up results
create reproducible code
